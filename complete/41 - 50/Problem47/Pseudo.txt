Prime Factorize a number
    Divide by the smallest possible prime number
        Store all primes in an array
    Divide the resultant by the next smallest number
        Iterate through the array
    Continue until the next smallest is also prime
        If the array is completely checked, and the next smallest isn't prime, generate the next prime and append it
        If next smallest is prime, exit the checks with the prime factorizations

Check the numbers around it to see if there is a run of four with unique factors
    Store the current prime factorization in a map with an array of the prime factors as the value
    Check the previous three keys to see if they repeat any of the current prime factors
        Start with the i-1 key and check the past one for repeats
        Check the i-2 key for any repeats with i-3
        If no repeats, print i-3
        If repeats, delete i-3
    Repeat until the previous loop exits true
